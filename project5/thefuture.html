        <h2>Activists have been able to push for many changes within Colorado so far, and these groups are looking ahead to make some major strides to help the climate by 2030.</h2>
        <br>
        <article>Since 2018...<br>
            <strong>Senate Bill 19-181</strong><br>
            Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC Update - Switch mission from “foster” to “regulate” oil and gas industry) <br>
            <strong>2020 New Setbacks</strong><br>
            COGCC changed setbacks to 2,000 feet
            <strong>2021 Implementation</strong><br>
            New Rules came into effect<br>
            <strong>2022 Denial</strong><br>
            COGCC shut down a fracking site from being built for the first time in Colorado history, suggesting a shift in public opinion.
        </article> <br>
        <section>
            While these have all been great improvements to the climate situation, Oil and Gas companies were still able to approve about 4,000 new wells before the new rules went into effect. New plans are looking at the November 2024 elections, as activists want to push for a ballot initiative that will phase out new fracking by 2030. This means that there will be regulations on the amount of new fracking sites that are built, and get increasingly stricter each year up until 2030 when no more fracking sites can be erected.
