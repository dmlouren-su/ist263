        Hi, my name is Dean Lourenco. I am currently a Graphic Design major interested in creating my own skateboarding brand. I have been able to become skilled at using the Adobe Creative Cloud, specifically Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and InDesign. I enjoy skateboarding and playing ultimate frisbee at the college club level. I am looking forward to growing as a student and developing even more skills to be successful in my career path.
